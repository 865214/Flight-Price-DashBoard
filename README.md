🚀 Flight Price Dashboard Project: From Data Cleaning to Execution ✈️

I'm excited to share the journey of my recent project where I developed a Flight Price Dashboard that tracks and analyzes airline ticket prices to provide key insights for business decisions!

Here's a quick overview of the steps involved:

🔍 Data Cleaning: Starting with a large dataset, I ensured data quality by identifying and handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies. This was crucial in creating a solid foundation for accurate analysis.

📊 Data Transformation & Aggregation: The raw data was transformed into meaningful insights by aggregating it by variables like flight routes, dates, times, and airlines, making it easier to identify patterns and trends.

📈 Visualizing Insights: Using powerful tools like Power BI/Tableau (whichever you used), I designed a user-friendly dashboard that presents flight price trends, comparisons between airlines, and predictive insights on when to book the best flights.

⚡ Execution & Deployment: After refining the dashboard, it was deployed, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions in real-time, helping to optimize travel budgets and forecasting.

I'm proud of how this dashboard is helping teams quickly spot pricing trends and act swiftly to find the best deals on flights.

Looking forward to applying these skills in future data-driven projects! 🚀
